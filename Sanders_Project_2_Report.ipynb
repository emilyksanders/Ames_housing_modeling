    "The housing market in Ames, Iowa is [small but competitive](https://www.redfin.com/city/477/IA/Ames/housing-market), and houses often go quickly (Redfin, 2024).  In such a market, realtors and their clients can gain advantage by correctly estimating how much a house will sell for, whether the client is buying or selling.  In this report, I will produce and explain a model that realtors can use to make this estimate.  As a secondary goal, I will look for elements of a house that contribute greatly to its value, to give sellers some ideas of how to improve their home's resale value."

    "- **A model calibrated to predict home sale prices.**  I will assess the quality of this model primarily through *R-squared*, a measure of how much of the variability in home prices it can predict, and *Root Mean Square Error* (RMSE), a measure of how far, in dollars, the model's predictions tend to be from reality.  It is unfortunately not possible to create a model with no error.\n",

    "In this report, I will use the Python programming language and relevant modules to develop and test linear models to predict the price a house will sell for based on its characteristics.  I intend to fit at least one ordinary least-squares, one Ridge, and one LASSO regression model, and iteratively improve them until they can explain a sufficient portion of the overall variance in home prices, and/or sufficiently minimize the average distance between the model's predictions and the actual sale prices in the dataset, whichever is practicable.  Furthermore, I intend to create at least one model with a particular eye towards interpretation - that is, sacrificing predictive power if necessary in order to draw insights about the drivers of home prices.  Although it is impossible to say at the outset of such a project how successful it will be (as they say, one cannot get $R^2$ from a stone, or something to that effect), I am optimistic that I will be able to produce a model my clients will find useful when working with their clients, helping the realtors of Ames to thrive in their careers, and the people they serve to find happy homes."

    "The data for this project were [provided by the commissioners](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/318-ames-competition/leaderboard) of the project.  It originates from the records of the City Assessor's Office in Ames, Iowa ([de Cock, 2011](https://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock.pdf)).  It contains information on 2051 home sales in Ames from 2006 and 2010.  Because of the large time gap between 2010 and the present day, I strongly advise my realtor clients to exercise caution when using my models.  As they surely know better than I, the housing market has changed dramatically in the past decade and a half.  However, a dataset in the hand is worth two in the tree, and this dataset is, I discovered, of unusually high quality.  It contains 78 columns describing each house, as well as two identification numbers and, most importantly, the price for which the house was sold, making for nearly 160,000 individual data points.  Although initial inspection revealed 11,040 of these values to be missing, further investigation revealed that all but 330 of these were simply inconveniently formatted, not true black holes of information.  (The remaining 330 were filled with [simple imputation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.impute.SimpleImputer.html); see [Data Preparation](#Data-Preparation) for more details.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Among these columns were facts and figures such as the home's age, materials, and square footage, along with subjective (albeit admirably operationalized) rankings of its quality and condition.  Basements, garages, and bathrooms are extensively detailed, and some of each house's personal charm shines through the descriptions of their pools, masonry, fireplaces, and more.  Additionally, although the data do not include specific addresses, each house is assigned to a neighborhood within Ames, and given a score based on its proximity to major roads or train stations.  If this amount of information was good enough for the City Assessor's office, it is surely good enough for my purposes too."

    "The Ames dataset provides information on the characteristics and sales prices of 2051 houses.  These data can be used to make predictions and draw inferences about how much other, similar houses in Ames are likely to sell for.  By modeling sales price as a function of the homes' elements I aim to produce one or more high-quality model(s) for my clients, Ames realtors, to use with their clients, home buyers and sellers, to help them make informed real estate decisions.  My primary goal is to create a model that generates realistic predictions so that realtors and their clients can keep ahead of bidding wars and capitalize on good deals, and my secondary goal is to create a model that offers insight into what drives home prices, and how homeowners can best invest in their homes prior to selling.  Below are some preliminary statistics on the dataset as it was obtained, followed by a discussion of how I prepared it for modeling."

    "Keen readers may notice some troubling signs in these summary statistics.  The *counts* row indicates missing data in a number of columns, and the columns for above-ground full bathrooms, half bathrooms, bedrooms, and kitchens each list a minimum value of 0, which seems unlikely.  Many of the columns represent categorical data, stored as strings, which will have to be converted to numeric representatives before it can be used in the model.  Several of the columns that are already encoded as numbers also represent categorical data, and will have to be encoded to avoid improper mathematical operations (e.g., taking the average of zoning classes).  Elsewhere in this report, I have described the steps I took to resolve these issues, as well as others discovered along the way.\n",

    "As these graphs show, the target variable, sale price, does not follow a normal distribution particularly closely.  Linear models can often perform relatively well even if the taget variable is not normally distributed, but it is less than ideal. Outliers can dramatically influence the mean, giving them undue \"pull\" in linear models.  Furthermore, the sparsity of values in higher price ranges relative to others means the models will get more \"practice,\" so to speak, identifying low- to mid-priced homes as compared with high-priced homes.  Overall, based on these charts, my advice to my clients is to take extra care when using the model(s) I create to make predictions or draw conclusions about houses estimated to sell for over about \\$325,000.  Be more vigilant when advising buyers about how much they can expect to have to pay, and be more conservative when advising sellers on how much they can expect to get or by how much they can improve their price with my recommended investment projects."

For the most part, I resolved these issues the same way I did with the basements.  However, one column emerged as a problem.  The column representing the year a garage was built is numeric, and to work in the model, would need to contain all numeric values.  This is not possible to do for houses that do not have garages.  While setting missing values equal to 0 makes sense for things like square footage (which is indeed 0 when not present), setting a year to 0 would introduce a great deal of unnecessary error into the model.  Therefore, unfortunately, I decided that this column needed to be removed.  I used this opportunity to also delete the two identifier columns."

    "In the interest of producing a model that is able to perform well on novel data, and in line with best practices, I used a train/test split to partition the data with known sales prices into two parts: the first and larger part, to fit the model on, and the second and smaller part, to test it on.  As is customary, I allocated 75% of the data to the training portion, and 25% to the testing portion.  In the first part, the known sales prices are used to calculate the parameters and develop the model accordingly.  Then, that model is applied to the second part of the data, so that its predictions can be compared to known values that were not included in its creation.  This simulates using the model on new, novel data, but in an environment where the true values are known and the model's performance can be assessed, and if necessary, improved by further refinement.  This process helps ensure that when the model is deployed by my realtor clients, they do not find themselves with a tool that does not work nearly as well in the real world as it did during development.\n",

    "Much like the ordinal variables were encoded to be numeric, so must the un-ordered categorical variables.  Unlike the ordinal variables, who remained in one column taking on as many integers as there were levels, un-ordered categorical variables are encoded as \"dummies\" - one column becomes many, with each column representing a single level of the original and taking values of 0 or 1 to denote its presence in a row.  Scikit-learn' `OneHotEncoder()` is helpful for this task.\n",

I first fit the transformer to the training data, where it learned all of the values in all of the columns, and then used those values to convert both the training data and the testing data.  Because it is possible for rare values to appear in the testing data but not the training data, or vice versa, it is important that the same columns - and only the same columns - be converted and created in both.  Finally, I repeated the basic formatting changes in the column names that I did to the original dataframe."

    "With all of the columns generated, it was finally time to revist those 330 null values in *lot_frontage*.  I decided to impute these values with the mode; filling the holes with the most common value.  Because the mode must be learned from the dataset itself, this could not be done until after creating the test train split.  The `SimpleImputer()` transformer, also from Scikit-learn, allows for efficient imputation in much the same way that `OneHotEncoder()` allows for efficient dummy coding.\n",

As previously discussed, the ongoing utility of this model to my realtor clients hinges on their ability to use it without extensive hands-on preprocessing.  If future datasets were to contain missing values in columns that the current data did not, it could slip through and cause the entire model to fail.  Applying the `SimpleImputer()` to the entire dataframe is a final safety net; most missing values have already been filled through methods tailored to their circumstances, but they will all be filled now."

    "As described above, my plan is to fit three types of models: ordinary least squares (OLS), Ridge, and LASSO regression.  Of these three models, and the iterations upon them, my primary goal is to identify a model with strong predictive power to estimate how much a house with given characteristics will sell for.  This will help my realtor clients stay ahead of bidding wars and help their clients in making sound financial decisions.  As a secondary goal, I hope to identify a model - maybe the same one, maybe not - that can offer useful insights for prospective home sellers on which elements of their home would be the most fruitful investment for an upgrade."

    "I plan to try a few OLS regressions first, selecting features based on their correlations with sales price, and in part based on intuition and common sense.  I do not expect these to be the top performing models, but they are a good place to start and get a feel for how different features relate to the target.  From there, I will move on to LASSO regression, a regularization strategy known for aggressively squashing unnecessary predictors and reducing the gap between model performance on the training and testing data.  I will also perform Ridge regression, a similar but somewhat less aggressive regularization method.  I will iteratively improve these models until their predictive performance plateaus, and then use the winnowed down list of features that survived regularization to revisit OLS and attempt to draw some inferences for home sellers."

    "The gap between a model's predictive performance on the data used to train it and on novel data is known as the bias-variance tradeoff.  High-bias, also known as underfit, models can be said to learn too little from the training data.  They tend to be simplistic and perform badly because they are not capturing the nuance of the data.  High-variance, or overfit, models can be said to learn too much.  They wrap themselves tightly around the training data and often produce very good results on that set, but plummet in performance when applied to novel data.  Their performance has less to do with actually representing a simplified reality than it does with \"memorizing the answers\" within the training dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The train/test split that I have already performed is one way to combat this problem.  For an extra layer of protecting, I will also conduct cross-validation testing during model fitting.  This is a strategy in which, instead of simply fitting on the training data and testing on the testing data, the training data is further subdivided, and multiple models are fit, using *n*-1 subdivisions as the training data and the last one as the testing data, with every subdivision getting a \"turn\" as the testing data.  If this strategy produces consistent results, it is safe to conclude that the train/test split will be sufficient to combat variance."

    "As shown, most of these predictors have to do with the size in square feet of various elements of the home, or with its semi-subjective quality ranking.  In 10th place is the year it was built, which I suspect has more to do with its age than its vintage.  These are all perfectly reasonable things for homebuyers to prioritize, but they do present a problem for my models, particularly the inferential ones.  In order to work properly, models with multiple predictor variables require that those predictors not be overly correlated with each other, also known as multicolinear.  For obvious reasons, different measures of square footage within the same house are likely to be multicolinear.  The rule about multicolinearity can usually be bent a bit when the only purpose of the model is to make predictions, and hopefully that will be the case in my work here.  However, interpreting these models requires looking at each feature in isolation - holding all else constant.  When the features are correlated with each other, it is not possible to hold all else constant, and the interpretation becomes meaningless.  This may make it challenging to find a model that explains enough of the variance to be useful, while also being interpretable. If all else fails, I can create simple linear regressions with only one predictor, and see what can be gleaned from that."

Despite a seemingly good performance on the two sets, the cross validation scores betray the truth: those $R^2$ scores are negative, and well into billions of billions.  That is not technically supposed to be possible, but it makes a point.  Regardless of whatever happy accident caused my testing $R^2$ score to be so high, dramatic declines in performance like that when shifting from known to unknown data indicate high variance, or overfitting.  It is likely that the plethora of predictors - 229, more than 1 predictor per every 7 observations - are allowing the model to fit itself by essentially \"memorizing the answers\" to which predictors in the training data correspond to which prices.  When asked to make genuine predictions about X values it has not been trained on, the model is unable to do it.  \n",

    "LASSO regression is the method I am most optimistic about.  LASSO is famous for taking in huge numbers of predictors and whittling them down to only the ones that \"pull their weight.\"  Unlike OLS, which is calculated purely based on the relationship of the predictors to the target, LASSO regression (and Ridge, which we will see next), adds a \"penalty term\" for each additional variable in the model.  The equation is then optimized to produce the minimum possible sum of the Mean Squared Error (MSE - a precursor to RMSE; the average error per observation, squared and summed) and the penalty term.  Any predictor that cannot add enough predictive power to reduce MSE by more than its value adds to the penalty term, is driven to zero in the process, effectively removing it from the model.  \n",

    "As part of the model fitting process, it is necessary to provide a list of potential multipliers to use in the penalty term.  The LASSO model within Scikit-learn then iterates over these multipliers, conducts cross-validation tests while fitting a model on X_train and y_train, and automatically selected the combination of parameters that produce the best $R^2$ score.\n",

Overall, the model picked approximately 49.2 as its optimal alpha.  However, when penalty hyperparameters get too high, they can cause the model to sacrifice predictive power in favor of conistency across seen and unseen data.  Allowing the model to fit using an alpha of 5, 10, 48, 49.2, or any of the other values it settled on netted only modest gains in $R^2$, and sacrificed the improved RMSE score in the process.  OLS models had RMSEs hovering around \\$23,000, the LASSO regression above with alpha = 1 brought that down to about \\$22,000, and the models with alphas around 49 drove it up to \\$24,000.  I assumed that my clients would prefer to be able to say to their clients, \"this thing can get us within \\$22,000 (as opposed to \\$24,000),\" rather than \"this thing can explain the same amount of variance, within 0.03 percentage points, on seen and unseen data.\"  With all of the values so close together, and none of them quite where I had hoped they would be, I erred on the side of producing something more utilitarian."

Perhaps if, as I hope, the model I came up with proves useful to my clients, they will invest in me with more powerful tools."
